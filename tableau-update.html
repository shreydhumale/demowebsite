                <h4>Salesforce introduces the next generation of Tableau, Bringing generative AI for data & analytics to everyone.</h4><br>
                <li>Tableau GPT is built for the age of generative AI, giving analysts access to AI-powered analytics for smarter and faster decisions.</li>

                <li>Tableau Pulse will provide automated insights and personalized analytics to business users and data consumers.</li>

                <p>Today at Tableau Conference, Salesforce introduced the next generation of Tableau, powered by Einstein generative AI technology. With Tableau GPT and Tableau Pulse, analysts and business users can automate data analysis, anticipate user needs and automatically generate actionable insights. And, new Salesforce Data Cloud for Tableau capabilities will bring customer data directly into Tableau, unifying it in a single view for fast insights.<br><br>
                   <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Significance: </span> The generative AI revolution will transform how work gets done, making it exponentially easier for everyone to tap into immense troves of trusted data to do their jobs more efficiently. Nearly 80% of senior IT leaders believe generative AI will help their organization make better use of data — which business leaders agree is critical for decision-making. However, 41% say they can’t understand their data because it is too complex or not accessible enough, and one-third cite inability to generate insights from data as an issue for their organizations. <br><br>

                    Tableau GPT can generate visualizations for sales leaders based on natural language prompts that display real-time progress against their quota, along with recommendations for helping them meet goals. If average order value is decreasing, Tableau GPT can generate visuals for commerce leaders that provide insights as to why, alongside suggested solutions to resolve the problem. Or Tableau GPT can automatically create visualizations for service leaders that display changes in their teams’ CSAT scores, identify potential causes — such as a high-level of active tickets and longer response time — and offer up solutions. <br><br>

                    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> What’s new: </span> By bringing the power of generative AI to analytics, and combining it with unified, real-time data from Data Cloud, Tableau is empowering everyone to make smarter, faster, data-driven decisions. <br><br>
